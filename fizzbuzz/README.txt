Exercise:

1. Write a program, that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. (Implement the `main` function).

2. Modify the program as following:
   - for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number,
   - for the multiples of five, print "Buzz",
   - for numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

   Implement the `fizzbuzz` function so that it returns the correct value to print.
